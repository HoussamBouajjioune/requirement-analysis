# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository contains the documentation and deliverables for the **Requirement Analysis** phase of a software development project. The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive foundation for a booking management system by documenting, analyzing, and structuring the requirements.

The **Requirement Analysis** phase is a critical part of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, which lays the groundwork for successful project execution. It involves gathering, defining, and organizing both functional and non-functional requirements, creating visual representations, and setting clear acceptance criteria. This repository serves as a simulation of a real-world development scenario, providing hands-on experience in software requirement analysis.

## Learning Objectives
- Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the SDLC.
- Efficiently translate project needs into structured documentation.
- Identify and categorize functional and non-functional requirements.
- Leverage tools like Draw.io for visual representations.
- Establish clear acceptance criteria to ensure alignment with business and user goals.
- Apply best practices to produce industry-standard documentation and diagrams.

## Repository Structure
- **requirement-analysis.md**: This file includes detailed explanations of the key concepts related to requirement gathering, functional vs. non-functional requirements, and use case diagrams.
- **Diagrams**: A folder containing visual diagrams representing the system components, actors, and interactions.
- **Use Case**: Documentation for use cases and acceptance criteria, outlining the interactions between users and the system.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and structuring the requirements for a **booking management system**. By completing the tasks in this repository, learners will gain practical skills in creating structured, comprehensive documentation that is crucial for the successful delivery of any software system.

## Tools and Resources
- GitHub: For version control and collaboration.
- Markdown: For writing clear, structured documentation.
- Draw.io (or equivalent): For creating system diagrams.
